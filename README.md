# Linked

This project constains scripts to:
- extract information from the European PATSTAT and OECD's HAN databases
- create networks linking companies that have collaborated in patent development
- create a visualization of such networks, with top patent developers

To visualize the network: https://dvasques83.github.io/dvasques83-medsci736/co-patenting500.html
